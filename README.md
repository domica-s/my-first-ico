# my-first-ico
This is a repository of me learning the basics of Web 3 via LearnWeb3DAO, and this is the sixth part, where I created my first ICO (ERC-20), along with the token's website, built using React and Next js

This project utilises the smart contract from my previous project: https://github.com/domica-s/my-first-whitelist-enabled-nft/

View the contract on: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x8ef94f6e9257715Ad93eEAaFBD6744d002E5bE56
